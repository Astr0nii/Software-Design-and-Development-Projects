            The <strong>operating system</strong> is an integral part of any <strong>computer system</strong>, therefore is must perform a certain 
            group of <strong>functions and tasks</strong> to be efficient and not slow down a <strong>computer system</strong>. The <strong>CPU</strong>
            must also have a <strong>cycle</strong> to <strong>execute tasks</strong>, otherwise it would be misdirected and not function properly.

            <span class="heading">Operating system</span><br>
            Some of the main <strong>functions</strong> of an <strong>operating system</strong> are: allowing hardware to talk to software, a consistent
            user interface for applications to use, controlling system resources, running system applications (sometimes multiple at once!). The 
            <strong>operating system</strong> has alot of stuff to do, however thanks to modern <strong>CPUs</strong> all of this can be done really,
            really fast.


            <span class="heading">Fetch execute cycle</span><br>
            For the <strong>CPU</strong> to function properly it needs a consistent <strong>cycle</strong>, thats where the <strong>fetch execute cycle</strong>
            comes into play. This <strong>cycle</strong> follows these steps: fetch the <strong>instruction</strong> from storage, decode into <strong>operation code</strong> 
            and <strong>data addresses</strong>, copy <strong>operation code</strong> into the <strong>instruction register</strong> and addresses into the 
            <strong>address register</strong>, <strong>address register</strong> sends data to the <strong>storage register</strong>, <strong>operation code</strong> 
            is sent to the <strong>ALU (Arithemitic logic unit)</strong>, execute the instructions, send the result to the <strong>accumalator</strong>, store results in 
            <strong>primary storage</strong>. This <strong>cycle</strong> is the foundation of the <strong>computer system</strong>, so without it the computer wouldn't 
            function.<br>
