            <strong>Software</strong> can be catergorised into to groups, <strong>system software</strong> or <strong>application software</strong>.
            These can be divided into the more groups which will be covered later on.<br>

            <span class="heading">System Software</span><br>
            <strong>System software</strong> can be further divided into these two groups: <strong>operating system</strong> and <strong>utility software</strong>. 
            <strong>Utility software</strong> allows a user to delete files, or create folders, manage shortcuts, antivirus protection and license installation.<br> 

            <br>The<strong>operating system software</strong>, also known as a <strong>driver</strong> is responsible for <strong>how</strong> your <strong>hardware</strong> 
            communicates with the <strong>operating system</strong>, it tells your graphics card or any other <strong>hardware</strong> component<strong>how</strong> to
            send the correct <strong>data</strong> for processing and <strong>where</strong> to send it. Without <strong>drivers</strong> your <strong>hardware</strong> 
            would be useless!<br>


            <span class="heading">Application Software</span><br>
            <strong>Appplication software</strong> can also be further divided into two groups: <strong>off-the-shelf software</strong> and <strong>custom software</strong>. 
            You can think of <strong>off-the-shelf software</strong> as: microsoft word, chrome, your favourite video game, netflix app and more, this group of 
            <strong>software</strong> is readily avaliable to the <strong>public</strong>, which means there should be <strong>considerations</strong> for a large varied
            userbase.<br>

            <br><strong>Custom software</strong> is a <strong>one-off solution</strong>, it is <strong>purpose built</strong> for a specific <strong>reason</strong>. For example,
            Coles has <strong>custom software</strong> for their <strong>checkout kiosks</strong>, this <strong>software</strong> won't be found anywhere else and was
            <strong>purpose built</strong> for coles to use.<br>
