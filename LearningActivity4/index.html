        This website is all about teaching you new things! It's also a collage of my 
        previous projects I've worked on casually from time to time. Currently
        theres not much to do (not even any JavaScript yet) but I've got BIG plans 
        for this site.

        Welcome to my website! This website was built for my senior high school 
        software design and development course! Its purpose is to educate me on how
        to program effectively, with efficiency and correct syntax.
